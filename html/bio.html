        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Known internationally for his work in many
        musical genres, EJ Bisiar is returning to his musical roots in rock, pop, country
        and jazz after nearly three decades of performing family/children's music as the
        "Original" Eddie Spaghetti (see
        <a href="http://www.eddieSpaghettiUsa.com" target="_blank">
            www.EddieSpaghettiUSA.com
        </a>
        ).
        <p>He was a member of the underground San Francisco
        music scene from 1968 thru 1975. The late 70's early 80's found him in Nashville
        working for a record company and the largest advertising agency in the southeast
        US before heading to Colorado. Recently, he's known for his Valentine song "Please
        Be My Valentine" which has been receiving more radio, television and download attention
        each year around the world. It's light-hearted, quirky and fun.
        <p>As of November 2011 new songs have started
        to be released. Working at Evergroove Studio in Evergreen, Colorado EJ finished
        "The Ice House Cafe", a song portrait of an evening at Evergreen, Colorado's popular
        gathering place for musicians. "Summers Wind" is a nostalgic laidback look back
        at life. "You're Not Gonna See Me Anymore", a bit of Rock that expands on the title.
        His latest release "All I Want(Is To Love You)" is pretty simple, with just vocal,
        guitar, piano and cello but with a hook that draws you in...tender but strong.
